# Aave V3 Flash Loan Liquidation Strategy

A high-performance flash loan liquidation strategy for the Artemis MEV framework, implementing ultra-fast liquidations using Aave V3 protocol with Alloy 1.0 for efficient smart contract interaction.

## Features

- **Flash Loan Liquidation**: Automated liquidation of undercollateralized positions using Aave V3 flash loans
- **MEV Protection**: Integrated Flashbots support for MEV-resistant execution
- **Circuit Breaker**: Risk management system to prevent excessive losses
- **Multi-DEX Support**: Optimized routing across Uniswap V2/V3, Balancer, and Curve
- **Real-time Profit Calculation**: Dynamic profitability analysis with gas optimization
- **Ultra-fast Execution**: Rust implementation with Alloy 1.0 for maximum performance

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **AaveFlashLiquidationStrategy**: Main strategy logic for detecting and processing liquidation opportunities
2. **AaveFlashLiquidationCollector**: Event monitoring and health factor tracking
3. **AaveFlashLiquidationExecutor**: Transaction execution with MEV protection
4. **Contract Bindings**: Alloy 1.0 generated bindings for efficient contract interaction

### Integration with Artemis Framework

The strategy implements the `Strategy<Vec<u8>, Action>` trait from Artemis core:

```rust
impl<M: Middleware + 'static, S: Signer + 'static> ArtemisStrategy<Vec<u8>, types::Action> for AaveFlashLiquidationStrategy<M, S> {
    async fn process_event(&mut self, event: Vec<u8>) -> Vec<types::Action> {
        // Process blockchain events and generate liquidation actions
    }

    async fn sync_state(&mut self) -> Result<(), anyhow::Error> {
        // Sync strategy state with on-chain data
    }
}
```

## Configuration

The strategy supports comprehensive configuration through the `Config` struct:

- **Liquidation Parameters**: Minimum profit thresholds, maximum gas prices, slippage tolerance
- **Risk Management**: Circuit breaker settings, maximum liquidation amounts
- **DEX Configuration**: Router addresses and factory contracts for supported DEXes
- **Flash Loan Settings**: Provider preferences, fee multipliers, maximum amounts
- **MEV Protection**: Flashbots integration and MEV-resistant execution options

## Liquidation Process

1. **Opportunity Detection**: Monitor user health factors and identify liquidation targets
2. **Profit Calculation**: Estimate expected profits accounting for gas costs and slippage
3. **Route Optimization**: Find optimal swap paths across supported DEXes
4. **Flash Loan Execution**: Execute liquidation using Aave V3 flash loans
5. **MEV Protection**: Submit transactions through Flashbots when enabled

## Performance Optimizations

- **Alloy 1.0 Integration**: Efficient contract interaction with minimal overhead
- **Rust Implementation**: Maximum execution speed with zero-cost abstractions
- **Parallel Processing**: Concurrent opportunity detection and profit calculation
- **Gas Optimization**: Dynamic gas pricing and execution timing
- **Circuit Breaker**: Automatic risk management to prevent losses

## Deployment

The strategy is designed for deployment on Polygon mainnet with the following contract addresses:

- **Aave Pool**: `0x794a61358D6845594F94dc1DB02A252b5b4814aD`
- **Aave Oracle**: `0xb023e699F5a33916Ea823A16485e259257cA8Bd1`
- **Uniswap V3 Router**: `0xE592427A0AEce92De3Edee1F18E0157C05861564`
- **Uniswap V2 Router**: `0xa5E0829CaCEd8fFDD4De3c43696c57F7D7A678ff`

## Testing

Run the test suite to verify strategy functionality:

```bash
cargo test
```

The strategy includes comprehensive tests for:
- Liquidation opportunity detection
- Profit calculation accuracy
- Flash loan execution logic
- MEV protection mechanisms
- Circuit breaker functionality

## Security Considerations

- **Circuit Breaker**: Automatic shutdown on excessive losses or unusual market conditions
- **Slippage Protection**: Configurable slippage tolerance to prevent sandwich attacks
- **Gas Price Limits**: Maximum gas price thresholds to prevent overpaying
- **MEV Protection**: Flashbots integration for front-running protection
- **Health Factor Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring to prevent invalid liquidations
